BeVexed 1.0
A maddeningly-addictive puzzle game.

If you've ever heard of a game called TetraVex, you will find this wonderful little time waster all too familiar. The concept is simple: put the tiles in the grid on the left such that the numbers match wherever 2 tiles touch.

About This Version

There's not much to tell - this is the first release. It has been tested pretty extensively, so there shouldn't be any major bugs and possibly not even minor ones.
